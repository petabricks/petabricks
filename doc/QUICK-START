PetaBricks Development Quick-Start
by Jason Ansel 12/19/2008

PREREQUISITES:

If you are running on a cagnode machine, all required packages are already
installed.  If not, you may need the following programs:

git
maxima
gcc (4.x)
flex
bison
autoconf
automake
autoheader
graphviz (optional for visualization)
liblapack (required for some benchmarks)


REPOSITORY:

We use GIT for revision control.  A guide for using git can be found here:
http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html

On CSAIL Debian, clone our repository with:
git clone /afs/csail/group/commit/reps/projects/petabricks

On non-CSAIL machines, clone our repository with:
git clone login.csail.mit.edu:/afs/csail/group/commit/reps/projects/petabricks

This will create a "petabricks" folder in the current directory containing
the PetaBricks source code. Use `git pull` to grab new changes.


BUILDING:

To build the PetaBricks compiler (pbc) run the following commands:
./configure
make

The compiler can then be found at ./src/pbc

You may alternately run:
./configure --enable-debug CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g"
to enable debugging traces (very spammy).


RUNNING:

The usage for the compiler is:
./src/pbc filename.pbcc

For example:
./src/pbc ./examples/add.pbcc

This creates the binary ./example/add and the output source file
./examples/add.cpp

There are some sample inputs in ./testdata

The usage for autotuning will change soon.  The current usage is not well
documented.  Check petabricksruntime.cpp for the code that parses command line
args to petabricks programs.

./examples contains a lot of sample code in petabricks.

Before you check in any changes, make sure to run our regression test script
with `make check`
