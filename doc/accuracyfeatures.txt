Feature #1: Accuracy metric

Provides an named transform for measuring accuracy of a given configuration.
This transform takes as input all the inputs and outputs of the original
transform and produces a double between 0.0 and 1.0 signifying the accuracy
achieved.  The autotuner uses this accuracy tester during training to classify
candidate algorithms.

For now the keyword is 'accuracy_metric', open to better names.  Perhaps just
'metric'?

Examples:

transform Foo
from A[n]
to B[n]
accuracy_metric Bar
{
...
}

transform Bar
from A[n], B[n]
to Accuracy 
{
...
}

----------------------

Feature #2: Iterative algorithms

A "for_enough" loop that lets the compiler decide how many iterations of
a loop should be run.  For this to make sense running the loop more times
should increase accuracy.

Example:

transform Foo
from A[n]
to B[n]
accuracy_metric Bar
{
  to(B b) from(A a) {
    for_enough(min,max)
    {
      IterativeStep(b, a); 
    }
  }
}

-------------------------

Feature #3: Grid coarsening

Allows the compiler to change grid coarseness automatically in order to
speed up algorithms.

This is done using a 'scaled_by' keyword that specifies a transform the
compiler can use to resize an input.  We reuse the 'tunable' keyword to
allow the compiler to pick the output size for a transform.

Example:

transform Resampler
tunable c(1,10) //int from 1 to 10
from A[n]
to B[n/c] 
{
...
}
